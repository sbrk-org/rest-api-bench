rest-api-bench
==============

Skeletons of restful APIs using different frameworks.

---

Requirements
------------

- Easy RESTful
- Models through an ORM
- Models can be linked together
- Handle auth (at least token)
- Decent performances
- Decent code beauty
- Be dockerizable (even if I don't see what cannot be Dockerizable :p)

Bonus
-----

- Caching system
- Documentation generation (blueprint generation would be amazing)
- Nice API -> HAL+json should be <3<3<3
- Builtin authentication
